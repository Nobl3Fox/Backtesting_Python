# File Summary
___
## yahoo_data_reader.py<h2> 
- It reads stock_tickers.csv to create a list of assets(tickers) that were included in the first column. 
- It takes that list and loops through it in order to scrape yahoo finance data and create a csv file for each ticker.
- The data is poured into the stock_data folder, this folder is ignored by git so make sure to add it back.
Note(I tried two approaches prior to this one in pullcsv.py file, but this approached worked the best.)

## strategy.py
- It logs passing of trading days, 
- It logs buy, sell, confirmation, and cancel order events
- It operatates the buy and sell logic as to when trades are placed
- It updates your P&L based on trade activity

## backtester_1.0.py
- It uses backtrader to define a portfolio size
- Define how much of the portfolio to use per trade
- (WORK IN PROGRESS) Define annual taxes out of profits
- It then pulls in the csv data created by pullcsv.py
- It loops through all the csv files in the stock_data folder
- Analyzes the data by processing it through the strategy.py
- A visual plot can be created to see performance results graphicly
- (WORK IN PROGRESS) It writes all trading strategy performance results and metrics to asset_performance.csv
